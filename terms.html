    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you
      read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our
      trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t
      try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks,
      copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Jan Bareš.</p>
    <p>Jan Bareš is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
      right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge
      you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
    <p>The OneSync Reader app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service.
      It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak
      or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
      operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
      your phone’s security features and it could mean that the OneSync Reader app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Jan Bareš will not take responsibility for. Certain functions
      of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by
      your mobile network provider, but Jan Bareš cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
      if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
      mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
      for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
      accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
      territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
      which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
      using the app.</p>
    <p>Along the same lines, Jan Bareš cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
      that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Jan Bareš
      cannot accept responsibility</p>
    <p>With respect to Jan Bareš’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear
      in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
      to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Jan Bareš accepts no liability for any loss,
      direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS – the requirements for
      both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll
      need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Jan Bareš does not promise that it will always update
      the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device.
      However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
      the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise,
      upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
      app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong>

    <p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
      changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective
      immediately after they are posted on this page.
